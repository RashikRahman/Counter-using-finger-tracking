# Finger counter with openCV+Mediapipe


## How to run?


**At first** You need to locate to the directory where you clone this repo. You can use command promt or anaconda powershell. To locate to repo you just need to type in this command. I am using Anaconda PowerShell. Run Anaconda PowerShell as administrator then paste the following commands.

```ini
cd 'path to repo'
ex :
cd 'G:\DS\3.Personal_Projects\Counter-using-finger-tracking'
```

After that type in the following command.

```ini
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Now to run the program use the following command

```ini
python Counter.py
```


**Make sure** you have a webcam attached to your device.
